*Burden Heritability Regression* (BHR) is a method to estimate the heritability explained by mutational burden in each gene, as well as gene-set enrichments and burden genetic correlations. BHR is described in detail in [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05684-z). Please cite the BHR paper if you use this software in your work.

**Setting up `BHR` on your machine**

This repository contains the `BHR` code. To download into an R session, run:
`devtools::install_github("ajaynadig/bhr")`

**Documentation**

For documentation and example BHR workflows, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/ajaynadig/bhr/wiki). Be sure not to miss the page on [eight common BHR missteps â€“ and how to avoid them!](https://github.com/ajaynadig/bhr/wiki/How-to-avoid-common-mistakes!).

We have also published other detailed scripts in the [`example`](https://github.com/ajaynadig/bhr/tree/master/example) folder, including scripts for downloading variant-level summary statistics from Genebass, scripts for running `BHR`, and scripts for generating the figures in the manuscript. Scripts for running the simulations in the manuscript are in the [`MATLAB`](https://github.com/ajaynadig/bhr/tree/master/MATLAB) folder.
